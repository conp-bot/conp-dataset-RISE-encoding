# Relational and Item-Specific Encoding (RISE)

This memory task starts with an encoding test in two parts: identifying if an object on screen is alive and if one object can fit inside another. Includes practice and trial phases. After there is a recognition test following the encoding test. Participants decide if images were seen before or presented together, in two parts: practice and trial.
